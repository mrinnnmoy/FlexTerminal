# FlexTerminal

Unified Trading Terminal for Stocks & Crypto ‚Äî multi-exchange order routing, visual arbitrage detection and one-click strategies in a single app.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem to Solve.

Traders today must juggle multiple platforms: broker terminals for stocks (MT-style), centralized crypto exchanges, and decentralized protocols. That fragmentation causes slow decision-making, missed arbitrage, fragmented portfolios, and repetitive manual order placement. There‚Äôs no single, polished terminal that lets users place synchronized orders across CEX/DEXs, visually track cross-venue price divergences, and trigger one-click strategies.

## ‚úÖ Possible Solution.

**FlexTerminal** is a desktop/web trading terminal that aggregates market data and order routing across centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges and traditional brokers (MT5/FX brokers, retail broker APIs). It provides a single UI to place linked orders, visualize arbitrage opportunities, run prebuilt one-click strategies and backtest or simulate strategies across assets. With core capabilities including:

1. Unified order placement (route the same strategy to Binance, Coinbase, Alpaca, and AMMs).
2. Visual arbitrage heatmaps and pair comparators across CEX ‚ÜîÔ∏è DEX ‚ÜîÔ∏è Brokers.
3. One-click strategies: copyable templates (market-making, triangular arbitrage, paired trades).
4. Smart order sizing and risk controls (per-trade and portfolio-level limits).
5. Real-time streaming market data, orderbook & depth visualization.
6. Portfolio aggregation and PnL across venues (realized/unrealized).
7. Backtest & paper trading environment.

## üõ† Tools, Languages & Frameworks used.

- **Electron / ReactJS:** Desktop UI (Electron) + React (TypeScript) for building a responsive, real-time terminal UI and charting workspace.
- **TypeScript:** Primary language for frontend and backend services for type-safety and developer ergonomics.
- **Node.js:** Backend runtime to orchestrate gateway APIs, adapters, and user sessions.
- **Express.js / Fastify:** Framework for building RESTful and internal APIs between UI and backend services.
- **CCXT:** Unified library for interacting with many centralized crypto exchanges (order placement, market data).
- **FIX Engine / MT5 Bridge:** Integration layer for brokers and MT5-style execution (FIX protocol or broker SDKs).
- **ethers.js / web3.js / @solana/web3.js:** On-chain libraries for composing and signing DEX transactions on EVM chains and Solana.
- **Redis:** Fast cache and ephemeral state store for orderbooks, rate-limiting, and session data.
- **PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB:** Persistent storage and time-series DB for historical tick data, trades, and PnL calculations.
- **Rust / Go (optional):** Low-latency microservices for execution engine, market data normalization, or strategy runner.
- **Python (Pandas / Backtesting libs):** Strategy backtesting, analytics, and quant research modules.
- **WebSockets:** Real-time streaming of market data, order updates, and UI push messages.
- **Charting Library (TradingView / Lightweight custom):** High-performance candlestick charts, depth charts, and custom arbitrage visualizations.
- **WalletConnect / MetaMask / Custodial SDKs:** Wallet connections for signing on-chain DEX trades.
- **CI/CD & Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes for deployment of microservices and scaling market-data pipelines.

## üîÉ Steps to be followed in order to make valid contributions to this repo.

**1.** Fork the [FlexTerminal](https://github.com/mrinnnmoy/FlexTerminal) repo by clicking on the fork button on the top of the page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

**2.** Clone the forked repository

        git clone "https://github.com/<your-github-username>/FlexTerminal"

- Download and install Node JS v16.16.0
- Download and install Git.
- Go to the terminal of your code editor and run "npm install" to download packages.
- Run "npm run dev" to start a local server.

**3.** Make necessary changes and commit those changes. <br />
Remember never push anything to the Main branch. <br />

Always change your branch to "develop" using:

    git checkout develop

Again check your current branch using:

    git branch

It should point \*develop

Now add your changes using:

    git add files-you-edited

If there are multiple files you can use:

    git add .

Now create a commit message using:

    git commit -m "<commit-message-goes-here>"

**4.** Push changes to GitHub

    git push origin develop

**5.** Create a Pull Request üëã<br>

Now you go to your repository on GitHub, you‚Äôll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button and now write a summary of what changes you have done. (Attach images if required). I will review your code and merge it if it passes all the tests.‚ù§Ô∏è
