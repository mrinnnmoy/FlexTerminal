Social Media Embed for Solana NFTs with Ownership Display & Liquidating an NFT to Any Token.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem to Solve.

There is a growing demand for easy ways to showcase Solana NFTs on social media platforms, along with information about the current owner's Twitter handle. Existing solutions do not provide a simple URL that generates a summary card with a large image and ownership information, making it difficult for users to share and display their NFTs on social media.

## ‚úÖ Possible Solution.

**NFTFlex** is a user-friendly platform that enables users to display their Solana NFTs on social media with the following features:

1. **Social Media Embed**: Automatically generates a summary card with a large image and the owner's Twitter handle using a simple URL like `showoff.me/:mint-address`.

2. **Cardinal Twitter Integration**: Displays the correct Twitter handle of the NFT owner, making it easy for users to show off their NFTs and build their online presence.

3. **NFT Showcasing**: Empowers NFT owners to showcase their assets on social media platforms with full ownership details, enhancing NFT adoption.
